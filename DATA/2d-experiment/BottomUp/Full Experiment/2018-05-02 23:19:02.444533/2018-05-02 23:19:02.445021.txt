Beginning Verbose Run for Accuracy Verification:

=============Initializing Experiment============
Generating Cone with: 
[(5, 1), (4, 1), (-1, 5), (-6, 5), (-1, 3), (2, 1), (-9, 7), (5, 2), (10, 3), (-1, 5)]
...

Extremal Generators of the Inner Cone: 
[[-2, 7], [2, 1]]
Extremal Generators of the Outer Cone: 
[[-9, 7], [5, 1]]
=============Initialization Complete============
