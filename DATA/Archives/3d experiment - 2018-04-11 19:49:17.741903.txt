Vector norms: [sqrt(43629), sqrt(33329), sqrt(26681), sqrt(29099), 21*sqrt(61), sqrt(26715), sqrt(21782), sqrt(23054), sqrt(21881), sqrt(20729)]
Vector to remove = (-112, 83, 36) and its norm = sqrt(20729)
Forming cone with 143 vectors in Hilbert Basis of D + Extremal Generators of C.
Step 299... Original number of extremal rays: 5, Now: 13
