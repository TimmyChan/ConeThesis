Beginning Verbose Run for Accuracy Verification:

=============Initializing Experiment============
Generating Cone with: 
[(141, 35), (-968, 753)]
...

Extremal Generators of the Inner Cone: 
[[763, 635]]
Extremal Generators of the Outer Cone: 
[[-968, 753], [141, 35]]
=============Initialization Complete============
